An open source loan origination system for commercial, consumer, and government guaranteed (SBA and USDA) lending.

I'm in the very beginning stages here and while I have have been working in commerical credit/underwriting for the last decade, I'm still a beginner at coding outside of VBA. I'm using this as a learning experience to continue to learn coding while appylying my professional background.

I'm using ChatGPT-4 to assist with the backend coding and debugging.

I've uploaded models.py files to the /loans and /relationships folder, though there is still more to add to both.
