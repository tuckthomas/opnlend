**Introduction**

I'm in the very beginning stages, including planning and design. While I have have been working in commerical credit/underwriting for the last decade, I'm still a beginner at coding outside of VBA. I'm using this as a learning experience to continue to learn coding while appylying my professional background. I'm using ChatGPT-4 to assist with the backend coding and debugging.

I've uploaded some intial models.py files to the /loans and /relationships folder, though much remains to be added to both. I'll update this readme soon to reflect initial project goals and features that are to be added.
