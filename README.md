**_An open source loan origination system for commercial and government guaranteed (SBA and USDA) lending._**

**Introduction**

I'm in the very beginning stages, including planning and design. While I have have been working in commerical credit/underwriting for the last decade, I'm still a beginner at coding outside of VBA. I have experience utilzing various different loan origination systems (Fusion Credit Quest, Abrigo Sageworks, nCino, and others), as well as collabarating with LOS engineers when improving financial institutions' existing integrations. During downtime at my last job, I coded a VBA-based Commercial Loan Review, Underwriting, and Spreadsheet application within Excel. However, due to it being Excel, it came with limitations that could ultimately be overcome through a web-based (hosted) application.

I'm more so using this application as a learning project to continue to learn coding while appylying my professional experience. I'm using ChatGPT-4 to assist with the backend coding and debugging. **_Also, I'll almost certainly have to halt future development of this upon beginning my next job due to likely having to sign Intellectual Property Assignment contracts. In the meantime, it keeps my credit skillset sharp while adding additional skills (Python and PostgreSQL)._**

I've uploaded some intial models.py files to the /loans and /relationships folder, though much remains to be added to both. Many of the initial loan's model.py were created with the SBA's Form 1920 in mind, allowing for automated population of the form later down the road. I've also uploaded a Financial Spreading Model that I created in Excel. While I could embedd it as the spreadsheet solution to this application, I think there are better options. I'm more so uploading it as an example.

I'll update this readme soon to reflect initial project goals and features that are to be added.
